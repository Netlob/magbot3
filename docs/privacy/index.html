			<P>This is a standard website or web app privacy policy, which will

				GDPR).</P>
			<P>This policy covers the following matters (amongst others): the
				collection of personal information; the use of that personal
				information; the legal bases for the processing of that information;
				disclosures of that personal information to third parties;
				international transfers of personal information; and the use of
				cookies on the website.</P>
			<P>This document might not be suitable for you if the ways in which
				you use personal information are complex or unusual.</P>
			<P>In any event, there are many aspects to data protection
				compliance. Publishing a privacy policy or statement containing the

				- of compliance.</P>
			<P><B>Section 1: Introduction</B></P>
			<P><B>Section 1.1</B></P>
			<P>Optional element.</P>
			<P><B>Section 1.2</B></P>
			<P>&quot;Personal data&quot; is defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR:</P>
			<P>&quot;(1) 'personal data' means any information relating to an
				identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an
				identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
				indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a
				name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier
				or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
				genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that

			<P><B>Section 3: How we use your personal data</B></P>
			<P>Article 13(1) of the GDPR provides that:</P>
			<P>&quot;(1) Where personal data relating to a data subject are
				collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time
				when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of
				the following information: ... (c) the purposes of the processing for
				which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for
				the processing; (d) where the processing is based on point (f) of
				Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or
				by a third party&quot;.</P>
			<P>Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR provides that:</P>
			<P>&quot;(1) Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent
				that at least one of the following applies: ... (f) processing is
				necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the
				controller or by a third party, except where such interests are
				overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
				data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular
				where the data subject is a child.&quot;</P>
			<P><B>Section 3.1</B></P>
			<P>Article 14 of the GDPR, which applies where personal information
				is not obtained from the data subject, provides that information
				about &quot;the categories of personal data concerned&quot; must be
				supplied to data subjects.</P>
			<P>Article 13 of the GDPR, which applies where personal information
				is obtained from the data subject, does not include an equivalent
				provision.</P>
			<P>Nonetheless, we have included references to general categories of
				data in this document, because this facilitates the identification of
				particular purposes of processing and the legal bases of processing -
				information which does need to be provided under Article 13.</P>

			<P><B>Section 8.6</B></P>
			<P>Article 18(1) of the GDPR states:</P>

			<P><B>Section 14.1</B></P>
			<P>Some data controllers and data processors will have an obligation
				to appoint a data protection officer (DPO). The basic obligation is
				set out in Article 37(1) of the GDPR:</P>
			<P>&quot;(1) The controller and the processor shall designate a data
				protection officer in any case where: (a) the processing is carried
				out by a public authority or body, except for courts acting in their
				judicial capacity; (b) the core activities of the controller or the
				processor consist of processing operations which, by virtue of their
				nature, their scope and/or their purposes, require regular and
				systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale; or (c) the
				core activities of the controller or the processor consist of
				processing on a large scale of special categories of data pursuant to
				Article 9 and personal data relating to criminal convictions and
				offences referred to in Article 10.&quot;</P>
			<P>Article 13(1)(b) of the GDPR provides that:</P>
			<P>&quot;(1) Where personal data relating to a data subject are
				collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time
				when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of
				the following information ... (b) the contact details of the data
				protection officer, where applicable&quot;.</P>
			<P>See also Article 14(1)(b).</P>
